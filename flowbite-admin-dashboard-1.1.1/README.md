## Admin Dashboard HTML for Flowbite Pro

Please make sure that you have both [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) installed to get started.

Install all of the depencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

To compile and watch for changes run this command:

```
npm run start
```

This will generate an `app.css` and `app.bundle.js` file inside the `dist/` folder which is included in all HTML templates inside the `src/html/` files.

You can preview the code by opening up any of the files directly in your browser, such as the `src/html/index.html` file.

Please note that the best way to use these templates is to include them into your own stack such as Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask or a front-end library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
