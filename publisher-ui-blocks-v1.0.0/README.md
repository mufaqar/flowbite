## Publisher UI blocks for Flowbite Pro

Please make sure that you have both [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) installed to get started.

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies in the `package.json` file.

Run and watch for changes:

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

### How to use the blocks

Ideally you should just copy-paste these blocks inside your project where you already have Tailwind CSS and Flowbite installed.
